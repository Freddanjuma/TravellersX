Hi, I'm Fred Danjuma ‚Äî Junior Web Developer
I'm currently a Software Engineering student at ALX Africa, passionate about using code to solve real-world problems.
I love building tools that empower communities, and I'm currently leading a tourism-based tech project called TravellersXperience.com.
a platform designed to help travelers access affordable HOTELS/TRANSPORT SERVICES and curated experiences across Africa.
My mission is to use software to solve real-world problems, especially in underserved sectors like tourism and local business. 
That passion led to my current project: TravellersXperience.com, a digital solution for affordable tourism across Africa.
I believe in tech that connects people and drives opportunity. Outside of coding, I enjoy team leadership, documenting ideas, and staying physically active.


üîπ TravellersXperience.com (Ongoing)
A booking and rate-tracking platform tailored for budget travelers and local HOTELS/TRANSPORT SERVICES.

## üß† Why I Built It

As part of my **ALX Software Engineering journey**, I created this project to solve a real-world challenge faced by many ACCOMMODATIONS/TRANSPORT SERVICES  including one I manage (ROYAL GUEST HOUSE).
With firsthand experience of the struggles local hosts face with platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com, I wanted to:
- Build a tech solution for local tourism businesses
- Provide travelers with reliable, easy-to-navigate travel tools
- Apply my backend development skills to a meaningful cause
